Simply put, I'm looking for a new maintainer for JuliaFormatter.jl. I no longer have the bandwidth nor the desire to keep working on this project. If you would like to be involved please reach out to me at the email in my profile.

You can stop reading at this point if you wish. I'll write a short blurb as to why I'm making this decision.

* I no longer have the time to meaningfully work on this project. In order for this project to progress someone else has to take the reins.
* I no longer have fun working on this project. There used to be a time where receiving an issue notification in my email was exciting. I would fix the issue, or think about the feature request, and then work on it. This gave me joy. I used really, really enjoy this. Even though this project did everything I ever wanted pre 1.0, if I could make a change that would benefit someone else it would make me happy. The whole concept of "styles" was to be as accommodating as possible. A few years in, this stopped.
* I'm making mistakes. I recently committed a change that broke pre commit CI and truth be told I was an autopilot throughout this - and not the good kind! ()Is there good kind?) I wouldn't have made these errors before , but I'm making them now.
* Realistically, I probably should have done this a couple of years ago.
